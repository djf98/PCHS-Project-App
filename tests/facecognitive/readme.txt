USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:

Thanks for using this cognitive test. A few things have to happen to make it run on your computer

1. If you are using the photos provided, there is nothing to do but run the index.html file using the live server option on VScode.
Make sure to download VScode, and click on the button on the left that looks like blocks. Then type in live server, and install
the first package that pops up.

2. If you are using your own photos, please make sure of a couple things:

The file structure should be as such. A big folder called "photos". In the "photos" file, there should be 
subfolders for each emotion listed: 'angry', 'disgusted', 'fearful', 'happy', 'neutral', 'sad', 'surprised'.
Additionally, the images should be name as such "im(any number here).png. If you want to use different types of pictures, or have a different naming 
convention, please email "matthew.joyson@gmail.com" to get that function added.

You then need to run the getlist.py file by clicking the play button in the top right. If you do not have a play button, 
look at the top options and press terminal --> new terminal. A terminal should show up in the bottom of your screen.
Type in "python getlist.py", or "python3 getlist.py"

TO RUN CODE:
After you have verified the above information, right click on index.html and click "Open with Live Server".
A new window should pop up on your browser, and the application should start.
Thank you for reading. If you have any questions, text 724-841-4770, or email as mentioned above.
