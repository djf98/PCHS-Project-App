# GitHub page for PCHS Neurocognitive Test

`home.html` is the homepage for the website. This will be the landing page for the app.

Within `home.html` there will be links to the various tests we will implement

All tests that we implement should be stored in the `tests/` directory, with the .html and .js files stored in the `tests/html/` and `tests/script` directories, respectively.
